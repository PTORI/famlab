##### Abstract

A large body of research in the study of memory has accumulated to date on the part-list cuing impairment in recall. This phenomenon refers to the lower recall of studied information in the presence of some studied words provided as retrieval cues compared to when no cues are provided. We review the current literature on the part-list cuing impairment in recall and report a meta-analysis utilizing the procedural and statistical information obtained from 109 samples (N = 5,605). In each experiment, participants studied a list of words and subsequently performed a recall task either in the presence or absence of part-list cues. The meta-analysis shows that the part-list cuing impairment is a robust, medium-sized impairment (Cohen, 1988). This recall impairment was not significantly sensitive to the number of study items provided, the relationship among study items, the number of part-list cues provided, the amount of time provided for recall, or certain other factors of interest. Our analyses also demonstrate that longer retention periods between study and retrieval mitigate the part-list cuing impairment in recall. We discuss the implications of meta-analysis results for elements of experimental design, the findings of past literature, as well as the underlying theoretical mechanisms proposed to account for this impairment in recall and the applied
consequences of this recall impairment.
