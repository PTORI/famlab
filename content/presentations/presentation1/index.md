## Part 1: Collaborative Remembering

This section discussed how chat-based collaboration can exert similar influences on memory performance as in-person collaboration (Greeley et al., 2022). Particularly, remembering with others online can facilitate the emergence of collective memories as well as improve individual, post-collaborative memory performance. See paper below:

## Part 2: Collective Future Thinking

In this second section, we discuss how people are typically negative about the future of the United States. In Peña & Rajaram (in press), we attempted to make people more optimistic for the future of the United States by presenting either negative, positive, or neutral primers before completing they completed a future fluency task. People continued to be negative regardless of primers presented beforehand. See paper below:
