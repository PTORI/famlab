description: "Dr. Tori Peña discussed a recent grant submission which proposed to examine whether the use of large-language models (LLMs) might homogenize human cognition. She reviewed some recent work reporting that people report more similar creative outputs (e.g., short stories, essays) after augmenting their writing with an LLM (i.e., ChatGPT). She discussed the potential implications of LLM-use on human cognition and social connection."

## Part 1: Creativity Augmented by LLMs

This section discussed how people are generally *less* creative after augmenting creativity-based tasks with an LLM. For example, recent work has examined originality in a variety of creativity-based tasks such as the Alternative Use Task (AUT) and Remote Association Task (RAT). Additionally, people using LLMs to augment writing (e.g., SAT essays or short stories) typically write similar ideas using similar words. See papers below:

## Part 2: Implications for Other Domains of Human Cognition

In this second section, we discussed future directions related to the grant proposal. This is ongoing work in the FaM lab in collaboration with Drs. Bren Bo O'Connor and Jason D'Cruz.
