## Peña, Pepe, & Rajaram (in press) *JEP:LMC*

Dr. Peña discussed work that aligned the collaborative and part-list cuing recall. The authors did this by taking the recall output of each collaborative group and generating cues for part-list cued participants. This yoked design enabled us to present identical cues and equate their presentation sequence across the two cuing conditions. They also devised a group-level recall index for the part-list cued “groups” yoked to the collaborative groups, thus equating the recall metric between conditions. 

Across two experiments (N = 270), they replicated both the standard collaborative inhibition and part-list cuing impairments. Collaborative groups exhibited more reciprocal influence on one another’s recall than part-list cuing participants, producing responses from the same taxonomic category as the cues more often than part-list cuing participants, and exhibiting greater collective memory. These findings provide evidence for the operation of the cross-cuing mechanism in social remembering relative to nonsocial remembering.
